    - each card has a button on the right bottom corner. When you click on that button the card flips over. The back side of the card has a translation of the word.

    - features described above for the training mode are disabled for the game mode. The "Start game" button is displayed.

    - a card with correctly guessed word becomes inactive.
    - after the start of the game, each click on the active card is displayed in the form of stars.
    - if all words are guessed correctly, the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù signal is played, if there were errors while guessing the words, the ‚Äúfailure‚Äù signal is played, cards with words are removed;
    - afterward, the application automatically redirects to the main page with a list of categories.
